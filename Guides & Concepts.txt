Guides & Concepts for leetcode problems

#1 - LeetCode33
    - Name: Search in Rotated Sorted Array
    - Dificulty: Medium
    - Description:
        There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
        Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) 
        such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). 
        For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].
        Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, 
        or -1 if it is not in nums.
        You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

        + Rotated Arrays
            - The procces of rearranging the lements of an array by shifting each element to a new position.
                This is done by rotating the elements of the array clockwise or counterclockwise.
        + O(Log n) -> Binary Search
    
    + Guide
        + Find the pivot point of the array to find where the shift happended
            - If array [1, 2, 3, 4] -> [3, 4, 1, 2] then '1' is the pivot point.
        
        + Perform binary search for the target
            - Start with the middle element of the array and compare it with the target.
            - If the middle element is equal to the target, return the index of the middle element.
            - If the middle element is greater than the target, then the target must be in the left
            half of the array. Otherwise, the target must be in the right half of the array.

#2 Leetcode34
    - Name: Find first and last position of Element in sortet array
    - Dificulty: Medium
    - Description:
        Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.
        If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].
        You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

    + Guide
        + Create a function to perform binary search
            - Needed because it will be used twice to find both ends of the wanted array

#3 LeetCode1
    - Name: Two Sum
    - Dificulty: Easy
    - Description:
        Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
        You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
        You can return the answer in any order.

#4 LeetCode5
    - Name: Longest Palindrome
    - Dificulty: Medium
    - Description:
        Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

#5 LeetCode9
    - Name: Palindrome number
    - Dificulty: Easy
    - Description:
        Given an integer x, return true if x is a  palindrome, and false otherwise.

#6 LeetCode26
    - Remove Duplicates from sorted array
    - Dificulty: Easy
    - Description:
        Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. 
        The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.
        Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
        
        - Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. 
        The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
        - Return k.
